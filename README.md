## Github production Notes:
```
—All files are uploaded through clean virtual machine packaging and
encrypted through 7.zip to avoid server infection

——Portable / How to make：
Any file I have on Github.   If the file suffix does not indicate —Thinapp.   
All are installed versions of software, and Fake-portable, using —thinapp 
to create files that don't enter the registry at all  

———In addition, all the techniques learned will be used to create software files  
The.7z format uses： (9 compression levels) compression method (LZMA2) Solid block size (Solid), 
so you can ensure that my files are fast and convenient
